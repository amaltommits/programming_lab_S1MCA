# interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
# import sys
# 3. math : Mathematical functions such as basic arithmetic operations, 
# logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.
#  import math
# 4. datetime : Date and time handling.

# 8. re : Regular expression operations.
#  import re
# 9. collections : Implements specialized container data types.
#  from collections import Counter, defaultdict
# 10. sqlite3 : SQLite database interface.
